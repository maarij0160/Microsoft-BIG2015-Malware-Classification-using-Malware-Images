# Malware Classification using Big2015 Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying malware using the Big2015 dataset. The model used for classification is the XGBoost classifier.

## Dataset
The Big2015 dataset , contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header (to ensure sterility). 
You are also provided a metadata manifest, which is a log containing various metadata information extracted from the binary, such as function calls, strings, etc.
The .byte files were converted to malware images, which were used for classification

## Result
The log_loss obtained was 0.18.
